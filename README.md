Try to read some information related to the sakto (SAP-field, engl.: "ledger account") from the line-item text of an invoice.
This means to evaluate rather short texts to fit a ledger account number.
Some things to try:
+ tf-idf encoding
+ word2vec
+ doc2vec
+ sBert
+ k-means
  and probably others that will pop-up while doing this...

The data used in this project are, of course, fake-data. So reality can and probably will be much more demanding...
